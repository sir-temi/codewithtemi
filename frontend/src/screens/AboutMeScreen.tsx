                    <p>
                        Welcome, let me give you a small gist about myself. ðŸ‘‹
                        I'm a seasoned software engineer with a journey that
                        began in the vibrant world of web and graphic design. In
                        my early days, I was well-versed in tools like{" "}
                        <span className="highlight">CorelDraw</span>,{" "}
                        <span className="highlight">Adobe Illustrator</span>,{" "}

                        <span className="highlight">WordPress</span>. My
                        creativity flowed through pixels and layouts, and I
                        found joy in crafting digital art.

                    <p>
                        But as they say, change is a powerful force. Driven by
                        my innate curiosity and a desire to expand my horizons,
                        I embarked on a transformational journey into the realm
                        of software development. Over the span of 7 years, I've
                        traversed a dynamic path, evolving into a well-rounded
                        developer.

                    <p>
                        My expertise spans a wide spectrum, including web and
                        mobile applications, cloud computing, DevOps, and

                        honed the art of creating scalable and efficient
